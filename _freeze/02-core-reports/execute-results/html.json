If it completes without error or only 1-2 non-critical errors, move to next step. If you run into a problem, see the troubleshooting subsection below.\n\n4.  Click **Publish** and **Save** (then wait)\n\n5.  In the popup select **Clinical Operations Report (CORe) workspace**\n\n6.  Click **Replace** (and wait)\n\n7.  Next click the link PowerBI offers once it is published to log into the online PowerBI dashboard and double check that everything is loading properly.\n\n### Troubleshooting issues with the PowerBI refresh {#TroubleshootWeekly}\n\n1.  Copy the error code that powerBI produces and add it to a blank text document for reference (you can usually click into the window and CTRL-C to copy and then paste into an empty text doc).\n\nBelow is an example of a PowerBI refresh gone wrong.

If you scroll through the Refresh Error Code and see a problem with the interRAI script (as in the example above), it is advisable to open the script in R and run it from there. You can find the source code in the scripts folder in the root of this data-manual project. Be sure to open the most recent version of the script. As of writing this tutorial today, it would be VIII. Open it then select all (CTRL-A), and Run it.\n\n    ![](images/OriginalinteraiScript.PNG){width=\"439\"}\n\nAt times, there are updates that can cause R packages to stop working which causes the code to fail. When you run it in R you can see exactly where the code is failing and hopefully correct it. In the case of the above error message, an R package was no longer working as intended so I simply found another package that would perform the same task, replaced the problematic R code in PowerBI and the problem was solved.\n\nIf you need to replace some R code be sure to correct it in the original R script *and* in the powerBI R query. You can find the BI version of the script in the Powerquery list, called \"ChYMH\" at the bottom. If you click on src for this query you can see the code and replace it here.\n\n![R interRAI script location in PowerBI](images/RScriptinPowerBI.PNG)\n\n::: fyi\nWhen you save your changes to the script you opened in R, save it as a new script with a new version e.g. from our example next version would be IX. DO NOT SAVE OVER THE OLD SCRIPT.\n:::\n\nIf the script runs as normal in R, the problems is at some other level.\n\n**Some other common problems:**\n\n-   An extra file or incorrect report saved to a data folder. Check the folders of all of the reports you downloaded to make sure everything that should be there is there, and most importantly, that there aren't any files that shouldn't be there. Its easy to save a non-related file to one of the data folders by mistake if you're working on something else while pulling the files (which I do often!). A random file in any of the folders will cause errors with the PowerBI query.\n\n-   A problem with a reference table (expand on this later)\n\nIf you understand PowerQuery (kudos to you!! :)), it can help to run through the various queries that powerBI uses to build the dash one by one. This way, you can find exactly where the query is breaking and fix it there.\n\nIf all else fails, contact your supervisor with the error code. This is often the best next step if the above steps fail.\n\nMake sure you don't have any of the files loaded in R! This can also throw errors.\n\n# Monthly Reports {#MonthlyReports}\n\n## File Audits {#FileAudits}\n\nThis task will be completed monthly. Accreditation audits must be completed at the beginning of each fiscal quarter (see below), while staff focused audits occur in the months between (Feb, Mar, May, Jun, Aug, Sep, Nov, Dec). The audit targets are calculated based on the last fiscal year's numbers. You'll find an R Project called \"File Audits\" that includes a script that will calculate targets (this only need to be calculated once a fiscal year). There is also a script for pulling a randomized selection of files based on those targets for the accreditation audit and for the staff focused audits. For specifics see below.\n\n\\*\\*Downloading fresh Audit record file\n\n-   use Case Data Data Extract in Column Format form\n-   select all programs\n-   Case Data Type File Audit\n-   select all File AUdit Info (top section) under results field list\n-   set date 01-01-2020 to today\n\n### CCA / Accreditation File Audits {#CCAAudits}\n\n**Timing: Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct**\n\nIn the R project you'll find a script and several R Markdown documents and some files:\n\n-   YearlyTarget_Script.R is the script to determine targets (this is completed once per year)\n\n-   FileAuditScript is the main script for pulling new files based on audits remaining (should be an object called \"RemainingTargets\" that will include the original targets and the audits conducted each month)\n\nBe careful, the updating of targets section of the script above will need variable name changes and updates--don't just run the script blindly.\n\nOnce you have the quarterly final audit dataframe, send to Nick so that he can evenly distrbute across clinicians. When he is finished he will send you a table with assigned clinican for you to enter into Emhware.\n\nTo add the audits, go to the specific worker's supervision file and add the audit.\n\n\\*\\* ENSURE YOU UPDATE THE REMAINING TARGETS TABLE EACH QUARTER AND SAVE IT!! You will based next quarter's targets on this (see bottom of FileAuditScript.) At some point we'll automate this better.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#readRDS(Audit, \"Yearly_Accreditation_AuditTargets_2024.rds\") <- the yearly targets. You will base your pulls on this\n#readRDS(\"Q3_Audits\") <- each quarter make sure to save the df of files that were pulled\n\n#readRDS(\"RevisedTargets.rds\") <- make sure to revise your leftover targets each quarter\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNeed to audit 2% of the total unique clients who received services in the previous fiscal year usually (\\~2,000 \\* 2% = 40 / year = 10 / quarter = 2-3/supervisor) Minimally 1 active and 1 closed file per program 1 closed file should be audited for every 2 active files Closed files are considered eligible if discharged from the agency within 12 months of the file extraction date Active files are considered eligible if the file was opened no less than 28 days prior to the file extraction date (for non mindSPACE/Brief Services programs) Files are only considered eligible if they have not been audited within the past 2 years Otherwise, files should be selected randomly The active / last worker\n\n### Staff Focused File Audits {#StaffAudits}\n\n**Timing: Feb, Mar, May, Jun, Aug, Sep, Nov, Dec**\n\nEach staff should have an equal likelihood of being selected (i.e., first randomly select 3 files from each staff) Each Supervisor should have 5 files to audit / month\n\nYou'll find an R script called \"StaffFocused_Audits.R\"--you will run this making sure you refresh the already audited files report from emhware (see above) by adding to the Data folder off the project root.\n\n## Case Review and Psych Consult List {#CaseReviewMonthly}\n\nPreviously you would open the Excel worksheet: Case Review Selection v3 at\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nM:\\DATA & REPORTS\\Clinical & Client Services\\Case Reviews\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNow, you will open the Case Review Psych Consult Review R Project and run the CaseReview.Rmd Markdown report.
