Our fiscal year runs from April 1 to March 31 the following year. Q1 = April 1, 2023 to June 30, 2023. All of these reports are running tasks on Asana.\n\nOnce the final submission has been uploaded, download a pdf version of the dashboard and place using naming convention found in the folder:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nM:\\Ministry funding (contracts, budgets, quarterly reports)\\BI Solution\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\nEvery quarter, mental health agencies in Ontario are required to submit data. ASK NICK FOR SOME WORDAGE FOR HERE.\n\nTo prepare for a submission you will first submit the data in the same way that you will at the end of the month. This is to check for submission errors. You will also complete several data quality reports (as outlined below) on the same schedule with the goal being to give yourself and the AA's enough time to correct input errors before the final submission due date.\n\nThese steps should be completed at the beginning of the month following the quarter you're reporting and again at the end of the quarter for your final submission. For example, if you're reporting on Q1 (April 1, 2023 - June 30, 2023), you would begin preparing in early July for the final submission which is the last day of July.\n\nWe recommended running through these analysis several times depending on how problematic the data is and once more after the AA's have completed their corrections (nearer the end of the month) to ensure the Ministry receives the most accurate data. Send the final submission one day before the end of the reporting month so that you have a day to fix any last minute things that may be off.\n\n### Submit BI Data to our lead agency site (the first step in any BI submission) {#LeadAgencyQuarterly}\n\nComplete the following:\n\n1.  In EMHware click **BI Submissions**\n\n    ![](images/bisubmissions.PNG){width=\"316\"}\n\n2.  Select **Greater Sudbury/Manitoulin/Sudbury SA (Service Area)**\n\n3.  **CSP** should be set to **core service provider (Compass)**\n\n4.  Set ***date*** to the beginning of the fiscal year & ***Submission End Date*** to end of quarter you are reporting (e.g. April 1, 2023 to June 30, 2023 for Q1 and April 1, 2023 to September 30 for Q2).\n\n5.  Click on ***Do BI Submissions to Lead Agency*** (top right)\n\n6.  Wait a while.\n\n7.  Click ***Send Organization BI Info*** (top right)\n\n8.  Wait a while.\n\n9.  Check if there were any failed submissions by selecting the start of fiscal year (e.g. April 1, 2023) and end date today (on same page) but change **submission status** to **Failure** then click ***Search***.\n\n10. Check that there are no errors linked to the date you are submitting and if not, continue to next step.\n\n11. To check that the data was successfully sent, head to our emhware lead agency website <https://la-cfc.emhware.ca/login.php>. Your manager will have given you specific log in credentials for this site (not your usual emhware account info).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16. Click ***LA BI Submissions*** (at top right)\n\n17. Ensure you are in the correct fiscal quarter and year range\n\n18. **CSP** and **SA** should be set to ***Compass*** **and *Greater Sudbury*** respectively.\n\n19. Click ***Submit Data*** to send the data to the Ministry. We can check that this step was successful ***the following day*** on the Ministry's BI solution website.\n\n### BI Solution Procedure {#BISolutionQuarterly}\n\n1.  The information that you uploaded from the lead agency website can be found on the [CYMH BI solution dashboard](https://www.ihbi.health.gov.on.ca/ibmcognos/bi/?perspective=home \"BI Solution Dashboarrd\") exactly one working day following your submission.\n\n2.  When logging into this website, you will be sent a temporary pin to your Compass email address. Use this pin to complete the login.\n\n3.  Click **CYMH** --\\> **Reports** --\\> **Exception Reports** --\\> **CYMH File Exception Report**\n\n4.  Look at the first row---here is where you'll find the information regarding the quarter you just submitted. This report will tell you whether there were problems with specific files. **Ensure there are no rejections**.\n\n5.  At the top you'll notice **\"File Submission Summary Report\"** and next to it **\"File Exception Detail report\"**. If you need more detail---particularly if a file was rejected---this tab will be more informative.\n\n6.  Next examine the **CYMH Data Exception Report** by clicking the folder with the people icon in the left toolbar.\n\n7.  The quarter you just submitted should be on the top row. Ensure that these numbers make sense and pay attention to whether any clients were rejected and if there are clients with warnings which may warrant investigation.\n\n8.  As in the previous steps, click the **data exception detail report** to examine any problems in more detail.\n\n9.  If you find any problems that need correcting, you will record these in an excel file with the emhware Client ID, the BI CIS ID, the program ID, the worker and the correction needed. This table will be submitted to the Administrative Assistants (AAs) to be corrected. Moving forward, add an extra column with the AA that completed the Program History; this column is for monitoring purposes and will be removed before Tracy sends the corrections on.\n\n![Example excel document for AAs](images/AAexceldoc.PNG){width=\"699\"}\n\n::: puzzle\nThe BI Solution reports do ***not*** use the usual emhware client identifier, instead they use the **CIS Client ID**. When reporting errors to the AAs it is important to include the ***emhware Client ID*** alongside the BI CIS Client ID, program ID and worker.\n:::\n\n9.  To search for a client id in emhware using the ***BI CIS Client identifier***, click on the ***\"Search Clients\"*** area in top right of EMHware to load the search page. Enter the CIS code in the ***MCYS-CYMH BI CIS Identifier*** field and click search.\n\n    ![Client search dashboard](images/searchclients.PNG)\n\n    You can also head to the BI Submissions Tab (in EMHware), enter the submission start date (beginning of reporting quarter) and then enter the CIS Client ID in appropriate box to search for the records reported for that individual.\n\n### BI Data Quality Reports {#QuarterlyDataQuality}\n\nPreparing these data is part of the process of ensuring that the Ministry data we submit is as accurate as possible. Any problems we find will be added to an excel report for the AAs so that they can fix any problematic entries. You will want to go over any complex issues with your supervisor (i.e. Nick).\n\n![Example AA correction report](images/AAexceldoc.PNG)\n\nFrom Emhware you will generate the following reports:\n\nUnder **Emhware Report Suite** dropdown select **MCYS-CYMH BI** where you will generate the following reports:\n\n1.  **BI Intake -- missing consents**\n    -   Set to the start of the fiscal year (e.g. April 1, 2023)\n    -   Select all programs\n    -   Click Run\n2.  **BI Intake** **-- missing needs assessments**\n    -   Set to start of fiscal year and end at end of quarter you're reporting\n    -   Program status: ***discharged***\n    -   you'll next go to the cymh reports tab, reset the fields, dates will be the fiscal start to end of quarter reporting. \"**Authenticated Records Only**\"\n    -   There is script at \\~/R_Projects/Data Quality R Workspace called BI Solution data Quality that has some code to help you do this. Just place the two files in a folder in the project (named after the quarter)\n    -   modify the code to match the file names and folder you chose and run it.\n    -   Basically you want to create csv file for the AAs with all of the discharged clients missing a needs assessment (see sample excel file in q2 folder of this project)\n3.  **Completed BI intake without BI outcome** This reports any client discharged from a BI program (not waiting for another BI program) without a BI outcome.\n    -   These are usually sent to the AAs in the excel doc mentioned above.\n\n    -   Occasionally there will be a client who the clinician accesses a psych consult for (MOH funded) but there is no BI outcome required for this as there is no treatment, just consultation. In this case the BI Outcome can be checked off but NA should be selected under Clinical Determination of Outcome.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n4.  **Client with active program history missing BI intake**\n    -   You can **ignore** **One Stop Talk** (for now)\n\n    -   **Day Treatment Consult** is considered an intake service (like Brief Service)---but only when it is the FIRST intake, so when a file is opened **BI Intake** should be checked off in the program history and the **BI consent** should also be filled out. Because it is an intake service we don't check it off as a service referral. **So, if there is a BI program ongoing that predates the Day Treatment consult no BI intake is needed.** **Also, if the Day Treatment consult occurred when another program was active, it is fine too.**\n\n<!-- -->\n\n5.  **CYMH-BI Assessment Needs without Process Sub-type**\n    -   New one, no info to input here yet\n\n<!-- -->\n\n6.  **Heads-ed**\n\n    -   ignore this one too for now\n\nIf any of these reports identify an issue (e.g. a file with a missing consent), investigate it and if it requires a change to the file (e.g. adding consent, changing dates etc.) you will add the requested change to your excel doc for the AAs (see above).\n\n### Pivot Reports {#PivotReports}\n\n1.  Go to **Custom Reports** (under reports)\n\n2.  **Detailed Program History and Client Data**\n\n3.  Select all programs (there is a filter in the R script that will remove the programs that are not necessary)\n\n4.  We want any client who was **waiting** or **receiving services** during the quarter. To get this data, set **Receiving Services Start** to the beginning of the quarter (e.g. April 1, 2023) and **Receiving Services End** to end of quarter (e.g. June 30, 2023 for Q1) and save the file in a temporary folder. Then run the same for **Waiting List Start** and finally for **Discharge Start** to their respective ends. You should have 3 CSVs by the end.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n4.  Use the \"Quarterly_Pivot_Prep.R\" R script to merge all three dfs, removing duplicate rows and programs that aren't necessary. Save as csv then open in Excel.\n\n5.  To check correct Program codes were input in Program History:\n\nOn the data tab of excel, ***Insert a Pivot Table***, then drag ***BI Service Identifier*** into ***COLUMNS***, ***Program*** into ***ROWS*** and ***Client ID*** into ***Values*** and then click on it to select ***COUNT*** from the dropdown.\n\nHere you will see whether the **Program** matches up with the **BI Service Identifier** that was input into the program history. For example, below we see that there were 3 Brief Counselling servicesinput as brief services when they are actually Counselling/Therapy service (A349). We also see a Brief Service input as a Crisis Support Service. These are all corrections we would add to the AA excel document for correction.\n\n![](images/pivottabble.PNG)\n\n8.  To double check discharge coding, go back to the main Program History sheet in excel and insert pivot table again, this time put **BI Client Discharge Reason** in **COLUMNS**, **Exit Disposition** in **ROWS** and **count** of **Client ID** again in **Values**. Label the sheets if you like to make it easier to switch between them.\n\n9.  In Exit Dispositions, if **Refused/declined** services has been selected as reason for discharge, **services delivered** as BI discharge reason does not make sense and should be investigated/corrected.\n\n    ::: lightbulb\n    To check which specific clients the bad coding belongs to, double click the field in the pivot table and it will open a separate sheet with the Client IDs and Program History info for those specific clients.\n    :::\n\n10. Add any problems or entries that need correction to the excel spreadsheet (adding to the same spreadsheet you created when performing the other data quality checks above.\n\n11. Once all of these steps are complete, send the file to Tracy who will send it to the AAs for processing.\n\n12. Before sending the final BI data at the end of the month following the quarter end, run these checks again to ensure everything is correct.\n\n### Comparisons of BI Solution data to our data\n\nThe dashboard isn't complete but the code and other stuff will be added here when it is.\n\n## Targets & Interim Actuals Bi-Annual MOH Reporting {#BiAnnualTargets}\n\nThis is a standing task in Asana.\n\nTo get current targets the BISP Report can be found here:\n\nThe first link is the actual template, the second link is a completed report.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nM:\\DATA & REPORTS\\Clinical & Client Services\\Clinical Reports\\Ministry Reporting\\Biannual Service Progress (BiSP) Report - 2022-2023.xlsm. \n\nM:\\Ministry funding (contracts, budgets, quarterly reports)\\22-23\\MCCSS\\budget\\MCCSS 2223 Budget Form v3 (SAP additional funding).pdf\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nTo update the BISP template for MOH program actuals\n\n::: puzzle\nplease note some reports will quickly generate and others will take some time\n:::\n\n1.  In EMHware Reports suite select **MCYS reports**\n\n2.  Set dates to the beginning of the fiscal year and end of reporting quarter. You can also use the Q1-Q4 buttons if you ensure the year is correct .\n\n3.  Under MCYS function choose the program you need data for. This will be informed by the headings in the Biannual Service Progress report. Once selected, the form will auto-populate. Click run and download the pdf.\n\n4.  Using this document, you will fill out the **Biannual Service Progress Template**.\n\n5.  For the **Brief Services** section, use the Brief Service totals (leaving out One Stop Talk)\n\n6.  You will choose newer version of stats not old.\n\n7.  For **Counselling and Therapy**, use the Detail Code total rather than the breakdown of individual programs and leave the assessed needs for Nick to fill out.\n\n8.  For **CYMH Coordinated Access Intake Service Planning**, use our numbers for number of hours of direct service. Needs Assessment will be taken care of by Nick. Ensure that the number of children by age groups adds up to the number of unique children eligible for service. If a young person transitions to a new age in that quarter they may be counted twice--double check and only count them as 1.\n\nTo see the individual youth that are being counted, you can access the *Detailed MCYS Report* and select the MCYS function (A352 Access Intake Planning) and for example INDSER# = number of individuals served.\n\nThese codes are found on the emhware page where you initially downloaded the MCYS numbers.\n\n::: fyi\nThe best df to pull for the unique clients served is the *historical client list all levels* with discharge as fy start and screening as fiscal year en\n:::\n\nSee the shared drive for an excel document that nick put together that reveals how he makes this calculation (in case R numbers are coming up different).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nS:\\Corporateplanning blah blah blab (add the good URL here)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n9.  For **Intensive Treatment Services** the day treatment program has 58 spots. Run a separate report see how many kids were receiving intensive services at end of the fiscal quarter to calculate that number (see the same R script as above). Number of families service in home will say zero so use number of individuals served Intensive CFI and number of children/youth serviced out-of-home the remainder of youth---add all\n\n10. **Case Management and Service Coordination Process is Service Coordination Process** in EMHware MCYS submission. Outcome calculations for number of caregiver/youth reporting don't use the one in the pdf (skip for Nick to do) can use the youth positive outcome in pdf though also for number of caregive/youths reporting pos exp w/service system.\n\n**Skip \\# of children/youth w/feedback of discharge also skip the transition one**\n\n11. **Specialized consultation/assessment** is pretty straight forwards except total number of training session which we pull from training calendar and count number of trainings (multiple days training for one program still counts as one)\n\n12. What about GDD??\n\n13. SNAP reports are weird carry over for households make same as children\n\n14. For SNAP gender numbers we might have to calculate as numbers in the pdf don't seem correct So calculate these numbers based on the df. Under multireports, client info and activity set dates SNAP group and individual and use these numbers\n\n15. Use \\^\\^ for language as well\n\n16.
