2.  Select client type "Worker" from the drop down

3.  Look up the worker in the Reference excel document to obtain their
    ID:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
M:\DATA & REPORTS\Clinical & Client Services\Clinical Data\ASEBA
```

3.  Add leading zeroes to make it 4 digits if necessary. E.g. ID of 342
    would be entered 0342 into emhware ID field.

4.  Add DOB 1990-01-01 for all workers

5.  Gender, Indigenous Status, Preferred language, highest level of
    education, citizenship status, ethnicity and mother tongue should
    all be set to Don't Know. Click save.

6.  Create lockbox by clicking on the name at top left and selecting
    lockbox from the dropdown. Select **"Deny all workers from this
    client"** from the drop down then click the + sign to add those
    approved to see the file. There is a list of approved staff for this
    list in the reference table.

7.  Next create a program history by clicking the workers name again and
    selecting **program history** from the dropdown. Click the green +
    sign at top right.

8.  Program should be **Supervision.** The little dropdown next to it
    should be Clinical. **Worker** should be the worker's supervisor.
    Referral source = self. Presenting issue = Other. Receiving Services

## Submitting New Form Requests to EMHWare Support

New Form tasks are tracked in an [Asana
project](https://app.asana.com/0/1150008016817939/1150008016817939) with
the same name.

When a form is ready to be submitted to EMHware, you will find it under
the Needs EMHware Submission & Review heading. Submissions that have
already been completed will have a "Submitted" flag in the EMHware
submission column. If it is ready for submission this field will be
blank.

To submit the forms you will head to [EMHware
support](https://help.emhware.ca/hc/en-us) page and click
`submit a request`.

You will upload both the French and English Word docs from the Asana
task (if both language versions are present) along with a pdf that codes
what type of field each one should be.

Some general guidelines for completing the specifications pdf:

-   Open the english version form.

-   Using the following color coding code the form with your
    specifications. You can also use comments to identify auto-populate
    fields, repeating fields and signature or any other specialized
    fields. If you're unsure of what type of field you should specify,
    take a look at some existing forms or consult with Nick or Shauna
    for best practice.

-   Once complete, you can add a legend and save as pdf. You will send
    the pdf alongside the two word documents with a little writeup:

    *Hi there,*

    *We need a new form created in EMHware in English and French based
    on the attached forms:*

    -   ***Request for Trauma Psychoeducation Group (V24.09)***

    -   ***Demande pour le groupe de psycho√©ducation en traumatisme
        (V24.09)***

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(scales)
print(CompassColours)
show_col(CompassColours)

## Compass R Markdown Template
